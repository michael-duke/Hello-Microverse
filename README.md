# Hello Microverse project

> In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. The goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps such as; ( implementing Linters, using the Microverse README.md template, making professional commit messages). I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!
